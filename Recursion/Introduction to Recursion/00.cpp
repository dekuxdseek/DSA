/*

Recursion - important to solve recursive problems
            which are made up of subproblems

Further used for adv. concepts like backtracking, dp etc.

    Way of thinking while using Recursion:
    
    high level and low level thought


    HL consists of solving problem mathematically,
    having expectation from function and having faith 
    in it for solving for smaller parameter, and finally
    finishing by linking them and giving appropriate base case

    LL consists of how it will work at memory level in stack

    space above calling - do work while going up in stack
    space below calling - do workd while coming down/getting popped in stack
